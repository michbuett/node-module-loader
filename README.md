# node-module-loader
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michbuett/node-module-loader.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/michbuett/node-module-loader)

A very simple loader which allows to load and CommonJS style modules in the browser. It does not touch your code and so there is no need for source maps. That makes debugging and creating code coverage reports very easy.
